# Git Commit Instructions

## Quick Steps to Save Your Progress

Since git is already set up, you just need to commit the changes. Here are the simple commands to run in your terminal:

### Step 1: Open Terminal
- On Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd "/Users/ty/oncallprep project"
```

### Step 3: Add All Changes
```bash
git add -A
```
This stages all your changes for commit.

### Step 4: Commit the Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Updated SCA info, WPBA requirements, enhanced reflection guide, improved layouts"
```
This saves all changes with a message describing what was updated.

### Step 5: (Optional) Check Status
```bash
git status
```
This shows you what's been committed.

## What These Commands Do

- `git add -A` - Adds all your changed files to be saved
- `git commit -m "message"` - Saves the changes with a description
- `git status` - Shows you what's been saved

## Your Changes Are Safe

All your file changes are already saved to disk. These git commands just create a "snapshot" so you can:
- Track what changed
- Go back to previous versions if needed
- See your project history

## If You Get Errors

If you see any errors, it's usually safe to ignore them if the files are already saved. The important thing is that all your work is in the files, which it is!
