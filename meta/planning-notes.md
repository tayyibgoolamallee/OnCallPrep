# Planning Notes

- Goal: tidy, documented static site with minimal serverless (AI reflections).
- Keep paths root-based for static hosting.
- Future refactor ideas:
  - Extract shared header/footer into partials (if build tooling added).
  - Centralize color palette and spacing tokens in `styles/`.
  - Split scripts into page-level modules and shared components.
  - Consider moving to a lightweight bundler only if needed (keep no-build for now).
