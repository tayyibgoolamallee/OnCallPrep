# How to Use Git on Your Mac - Simple Guide

## ✅ Good News: Your Files Are Already Restored!

I've already recreated all your pages. The red indicators are just showing that git isn't tracking them yet. Your files are safe and working!

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that:
- Tracks changes to your files
- Creates backups automatically
- Shows you what changed
- Prevents data loss

Think of it like "Time Machine for code" - it saves snapshots of your work.

## How to Run Git Commands on Mac

### Option 1: Using Terminal (Built into Mac)

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - Press `Command + Space` (opens Spotlight search)
   - Type "Terminal"
   - Press Enter
   - A black window will open - that's Terminal!

2. **Copy and paste this command:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ty/oncallprep project"
   ```
   Press Enter

3. **Then copy and paste this:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   Press Enter

4. **Then this:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   Press Enter

5. **Finally this:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Restored all pages"
   ```
   Press Enter

That's it! The red indicators should disappear.

### Option 2: Using Your IDE (If It Has Git Built-in)

If you're using VS Code, Cursor, or another IDE:
- Look for a "Source Control" or "Git" icon in the left sidebar
- Click it
- You might see an "Initialize Repository" button
- Click that, then commit
